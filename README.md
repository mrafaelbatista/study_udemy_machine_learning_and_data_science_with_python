by Messias R. Batista (@mrafaelbatista)

## About this repository
This repository is about my learning about python apply to data science and machine learning.I bot this course, which finding on Udemy platform. In this repository I put my codes created on course.

## About Programming Languages Course
I start classes to talk about Object Orientation (OO), is presented the fundamental OO concepts (abstraction, heritage, polymorphism, encapsulation), and many exercises to practice these concepts. Next, talk about file management (CSV or text), and error treatment. For last, to create a project with Django to apply all concepts studied, and to experiment with “web development”.

## Topics presented in the class
<ul>
    <li>Python programming language</li>
    <li>Numpy</li>
    <li>Pandas</li>

    <li>KNN - Classification</li>
    <li>KNN - Regression</li>
    <li>Artificial Neural Networks</li>
    <li>K-Means</li>
</ul>

## Requirements
You need to use a development environment, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "Visual Studio Code") or [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/ "Jupyter Notebook") and [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python Organization") to run the samples.
